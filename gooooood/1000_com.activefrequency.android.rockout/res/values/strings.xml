    <string name="about_title">About RockOut</string>
    <string name="about_text">"RockOut is a virtual guitar that aims to model the sound and feel of strumming a real guitar as closely as existing Android hardware and software allows.

You can strum up and down in each chord's area on screen for upstroke or downstroke sounds sampled from a real guitar.

You can also load different chord sets to play different songs (RockOut Lite comes with two songs and six chords; the full version will add new songs and chords every day).

TIPS: Try alternate strumming.
Real guitarists use patterns like 'Down, Down, Up, Down, Up' with different rhythms for variety.
Try plugging in speakers or headphones for maximum effect.

RockOut Acoustic Pro has:
- Downloadable chord sets
- Hundreds of recorded samples for dozens of chords
- Up to six custom chords on screen at once
- New free chord arrangements from the built-in Web Songbook every month!
- Tremolo effect pedal simulator
- Samples saved to SD card to leave more memory on your device
- Use the trackball to switch chord sets

RockOut Pro users will also get upcoming free updates for:

- Skinnable guitars
- More effects - pitch shift / bend, whammy
- Better audio performance and stability when Android's Cupcake update hits
- Keyboard &amp; touch gesture support
- Click / drum machine tracks
- Animations &amp; Visual Effects
and more! 

DISCLAIMER: Unlike a real guitar, RockOut probably won't get you laid. We will not be held responsible.

RockOut is a production of Boston's Active Frequency LLC.
