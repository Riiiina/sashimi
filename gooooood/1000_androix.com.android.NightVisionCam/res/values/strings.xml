 Hint: Try to start with increasing the Gain.
 
 Zoom will only work on devices which support it.
 
 Hold your device very steady (especially for higher shutter times).
 
 Multi-Threading will increase user interface performance.
 Single-Threading will slightly increase the frame rate on single core devices.
 
 Pictures will be saved on sdcard in /NightVisionCam/.
